# A7-Data-Curation-and-Analysis
#Goal: 
The main goal of this assignment was to try and extrapolate any interesting data trends from the top ten movies of each year in the 1980's. In that respect, it think it was successful! This was a very intersting process and I was glad to have a bit more experience with managing data which was aquired without an API. The data was both more and less in need of cleaning than I had expected. However, I mainly focused on the process of transforming the data into a more readable form. The analysis of the data was less fruitful. However, the trends in genre type and ticket pricing were interesting for sure.
#API Documentation:
Despite my best wishes, this dataset was not prohibited to be scraped automatically. This was a great experience with manual data management, but it was very time consuming. On the bright side, there was less cleaning to do when I was finally done transcribing. Initially, I attempted to utilize BeautifulSoup for data aquisition, but the licensing page left me no choice. ALL data was collected manually from the database pages for each respective year in the database
